 Given https://stackoverflow.com/a/59182595/10697358,
 metrics from sysstat:
  --  memory consumption
  --  network bandwidth
  --  file size transferred

 In scenarios on the spectrum from:
  - few users making many requests | avg users making avg requests | many users making few requests
  - machines with different nics


One thing we are likely missing given the 8 random queries is that the data passed is of different size(?).
